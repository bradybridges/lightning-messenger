## Objective

  As a developer with curiousity revolving around secure transmission of user data, I wanted to develop an application that takes advantage of encryption, RSA keys, and diffie-hellman type approaches to encrypting data. The objective of this application is to provide an end-to-end encrypted messaging application that allows a user to communicate securely with friends.
  
## Tools Used

- React Native
- Expo
- Google Cloud/Firebase
- Jest
- Enzyme

## Requirements

You must have node and npm installed on your local machine. This is used to install all of the dependencies of the application. To install these packages, just intall node, which includes an installation of npm.
 
```bash
brew install node
```

You must also have expo-cli installed globally on your machine. To do this enter the command below.

```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

## Setup

1. Clone down this repo.
1. Then install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```
1. To verify that it is setup correctly, run `npm start` in your terminal. Expo's metro bundler should open in your browser.

## Run The Application
